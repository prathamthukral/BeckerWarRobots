# beckerWarRobots

This was a culminating project part of my 12th grade Java Computer Science class.
The objective of the project was to build a smart robot class that would have a 2d array inputted (including details such as the position of other "enemy" robots, their health, and their energy). After calculating various scores based on various sorting algorithms, the robot would make an informed decision.

Final iteration of robot is called ThukralFighterRobot

Sorting algorithims used:
selection, bubble

Becker robots library was used.
